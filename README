1. About this document
======================
This document describes the common and non-hardware specific information.
Please refer to README.hardware for hardware specific information.

Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the oe-core version supplied with Wind River Linux
and the wr-kernel layer.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more
information on submitting changes.


Building the ti-am62 layer
--------------------------
This layer and wr-kernel layer should be added to bblayers.conf. This
is done automatically when using the Wind River configure wrapper.

The following table summarizes the valid Wind River Linux distros for this BSP.
'Y' in each content cell stands for supported; 'N' stands for not supported:

  +--------------+-------------+------------------+-------------------+--------------+
  | valid/distro |   wrlinux   | wrlinux-graphics | wrlinux-installer | wrlinux-tiny |

For the supported kernel type for this BSP, please check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e virtual/kernel | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES="'.

Note: The preempt-rt ktype is available for this BSP/Machine at this time.


3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP along with
patch descriptions use git-whatchanged on the default kernel. For example:

	%> cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/<bsp_name>/kernel-source
	%> git whatchanged <kernel_version>/standard/base..<kernel_version>/standard/<bsp_name>


4. Boot Instructions
====================

The typical u-boot settings apply to these boards. You will need to use
setenv, printenv and saveenv, to configure, display and store respectively
your network configuration details and kernel command line. In order to
TFTP a kernel, you need at a minimum to set the following:

	- ipaddr
	- gatewayip
	- netmask
	- serverip
	- loadaddr
	- dtbfile
	- dtbaddr
	- ethaddr

Your board may ship with the values for the MAC address of
the Ethernet interfaces set to the defaults compiled into the
u-boot image.  You should set the ethaddr, eth1addr and so on
as per the manufacturer assigned values, usually indicated with
a sticker on the board.

Target specifics are usually set in the "bootargs" variable, and the
kernel image is set in the "bootfile" variable. Don't forget that if you
want these values to be available after a power cycle you will need to run
the saveenv command.

Typically convenience macros exist that will create a complete bootargs
command line for the kernel based on variables that contain individual
settings.  Since these macros exist as env variables themselves, they
may or may not be present depending on who installed and configured
u-boot for the board.

The console device for the board is ttyLF0 at 115200 baud. For the DTB
address, 0x88000000 was used with success by Wind River. The load address
must be high enough to not interfere with kernel decompression. A value
of 0x82000000 was used with success for all kernels tested by Wind River.

4.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

Example settings for the monitor (u-boot) are shown below:

nfsboot=setenv bootargs root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=$serverip:$rootpath \
ip=$ipaddr:$serverip:$gatewayip:$netmask:$hostname:$netdev:off \
console=$consoledev,$baudrate earlycon=ns16550a,mmio32,0x02800000;tftp $loadaddr $bootfile; \
tftp $fdtaddr $fdtfile;booti $loadaddr - $fdtaddr
ethaddr=00:04:9F:02:00:FD
loadaddr=0x82000000
fdtaddr=0x88000000
gatewayip=192.168.1.1
netmask=255.255.255.0
ipaddr=192.168.1.100
serverip=192.168.1.2
netdev=eth0
bootfile=Image
fdtfile=k3-am62a7-sk.dtb
rootpath=/tftpboot/rootfs
consoledev=ttyS2
baudrate=115200

5. Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
===================================

User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator to create the properly partitioned
image on a SD card. It generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded
build artifacts. Please refer to the following URL for more detailed partition
information about WIC:

https://docs.yoctoproject.org/singleindex.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

5.1 Build WIC image within tiboot3.bin & tispl.bin in boot partition
--------------------------------------------------------------------

tiboot3.bin & tispl.bin are the firmwares of TI's MCU. Because of license issue,
they aren't integrated into WRLinux.

the installation file "ti-processor-sdk-linux-edgeai-am62axx-evm-09_01_00_07-Linux-x86-Install.bin"
includes the two firmwares, the installation file can be downloaded from website:
https://www.ti.com/tool/download/PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-AM62A

And then add one line below to local.conf:

IMAGE_BOOT_FILES:append = " <path-to-tiboot3.bin>/tiboot3.bin;tiboot3.bin <path-to-tispl.bin>/tispl.bin;tispl.bin"

After having built your project, a partitioned WIC image will be created in the
deploy folder as follows:

  path_to_your_project/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/ti-am62/wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-ti-am62.wic

There are two partitions in this WIC images, the first one is to hold the boot
images, the second is the related root file system.

5.2 Deploy the created WIC image
--------------------------------

Deploy the created WIC image into SD card(/dev/sdx) in your host machine.

   $ sudo dd if=wrlinux-image-<rootfs_type>-<machine>.wic of=/dev/sdx

5.3 Boot the board from the WIC SD card
---------------------------------------

Insert the SD card into the board and select this SD card as the boot device.

You have two ways to start the board:

1. Use the uboot’s default startup environment variables.

2. By set the below uboot environment variables:
   $ setenv bootargs console=ttyS2,115200n8 earlycon=ns16550a,mmio32,0x02800000 root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rw rootwait ip=dhcp
   $ fatload mmc 1:1 0x82000000 Image; fatload mmc 1:1 0x88000000 k3-am62a7-sk.dtb; booti 0x82000000 - 0x88000000


6. Features
===========

Before using the features below, it is recommended that you first add
WRTEMPLATE to your build local.conf to add series tools (Such as: can/audio/ufs).

Simply add line as follows to ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf:
	WRTEMPLATE = "feature/bsp-extras"

And it is recommended to refer to the "Foundational Components" of the sdk
release note "Processor SDK Linux for AM62A" from the TI web.

6.6 Video
---------

The Encoder/Decoder (VENC/VDEC) is a stateful encoder/decoder, it is found on
the AM62Ax SoC. Combined H.264 and H.265 encoder/decoder used in the Texas 
Instruments AM62Ax SoC.

The Linux Kernel Drivers has integrated the Video Decoder and Encoder as module by default.
Because of the license issue, you can manually build the Image as below to
integrate the gstreamer related packages:

6.6.1 Build Image
-----------------

  1) set BB_NO_NETWORK as '0' in ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf file.

  2) Add line as follows to ${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf:
     $ cat << _EOF >> conf/local.conf
CUSTOMER_RECIPES:openembedded-layer += 'faad2'
LICENSE_FLAGS_ACCEPTED += "commercial"
IMAGE_INSTALL:append:ti-am62 = ' gstreamer1.0 gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav'
_EOF

  3) bitbake wrlinux-image-xxx

6.6.2 Verify Multimedia feature
-------------------------------

An example to test with GStreamer Pipelines on target board:
	$ gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/<path_to_file>  ! rawvideoparse width=1920 height=1080 format=i420 framerate=30/1 colorimetry=bt709 ! v4l2h264enc ! filesink location=/<path_to_file>  sync=true

6.7 Build U-Boot
----------------

By default, the u-boot image is compiled and installed. If you want u-boot to be manually
compiled separately, use the following command：

	# bitbake u-boot-ti-staging

6.8 CPSW Ethernet
-----------------

By default, the CPSW Eth0 is enabled and Eth1 is not enabled. Need to install
corresponding dtbo file to enable Eth1 port, in addition to other environment variables,
the following environment variables need to be set additionally at uboot to apply dtbo files:

1. Boot from NFS:
        => tftpboot 0x82000000 Image; tftpboot 0x88000000 dtb
	=> fdt address 0x88000000; fdt resize 0x100000; tftpboot 0x89000000 k3-am62a7-sk-ethernet-dc01.dtbo;fdt apply 0x89000000;
        => booti 0x82000000 - 0x88000000

2. Boot from WIC:
 Just modify the uEnv.txt to add with below:
	name_overlays=k3-am62a7-sk-ethernet-dc01.dtbo
